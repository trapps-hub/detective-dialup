****COMMISSIONER BAGLEY:****

CONVO NO.1 - COMMISH RINGS YOU:

Morning Detective, new case for you to work on and it needs top priority. If anyone can solve this one, it's you. Ready for a rundown?

No -> Well, too bad, you're clocked in.

The victim is a lawyer named Lawrence Macor, died in the early hours of the morning from blunt force trauma to the head. He was found in a motel room next to a bloody broken statuette a few hours after his death by the cleaning lady, bless her soul.

Anyways, this man was working over at Merriweather & Co and from the looks of his file had a winning streak for some time - clearly his luck ran out. I've sent you his details, and the number for The Sunset Motel. That'll be a good place to start.

I'm relying on you and your phone to crack this case - don't let me down. Good luck Detective.

CONVO NO.? - COMMISH CONGRATS (ENDING):

Detective? I hear you cracked the case - congrats. Looks like there was blood in the water after all. Haha!

... Enjoy your weekend - I'll see you soon for the next one I'm sure.

... Hello? Darlene speaking.

morning, night, murder, body, find, found, Lawrence, Macor -> Yes well, I was doing my rounds as I do each morning, and I came to Mr. Macor's door to find it ajar, so I went to check if he was okay and well... there he was! 
Horribly bloody head, and god it was everywhere, I'm not sure if I'll ever get it out of that carpet.

evidence, clues, suspects -> Well, there was the broken statuette by his head, also bloody. At least we can just replace those. There was also a single napkin in the trashcan that had some code written on it, and then his phone had made two calls. That's all I know.

napkin, code, trashcan -> It was just a random bunch of letters in red ink, --90W-D? No idea what that means.

phone, calls, record -> Yea let me just check our system...
Ok so, the first one went to that Merriweather & Co office, #989, in the early afternoon.
And the other call went to a #565, around 1AM, but that number isn't listed on our system.

witnesses, suspects, see, notice, saw -> I know one of the girls saw him leave at around dinnertime but he was back before eleven. We didn't see anything else after that - we usually clock out around 1AM.

??? -> I don't know anything about that darlin, sorry.

goodbye, thank you -> Alright darlin, take care now, hope you catch 'em!

ROSA Maneres

CONVO NO.4

Uhh, hello, good morning, who am I speaking to?

detective, police, officer -> Oh, uhm... *deep inhale*. What do you want?

lawrence, macor -> Uhhh.... not familiar with them. Is that all?

90W, Roberto, father, dad-> ....Yeah, what about it? What do you want from me? My dad is long gone now. Case closed.

(Lawrence+90W,Roberto+Murder) -> ...what? .....I...we spoke yesterday. He was the prosecutor in the case against my father 2 years ago. My father was an innocent man, but that bastard lawyer had to put him behind bars... just for another tick in his file.

(last+yesterday, spoke) -> Yes! For two years I spent every night finding proof of my fathers innocence. And yesterday to my surprise the lawyer agreed to meet me to see that proof. I don't think proving him wrong made me feel any better... wait... you think I killed him?

(last+yes,alibi) -> I would never do something like that! The lawyer was wrong, but I would never go that far! We simply met at a local diner, I gave him the evidence, watched his face drop, and he left without saying anything else. I thought it would all end there. 

call, phone, brad -> Yes, we talked one last time. A short phone call in the early hour. He was warning me about his partner in my fathers case, I believe his name was Brad. Lawrence told me that when Brad caught wind that he was coming to meet me... he was furious, and threatened him, and well... now he's dead. I don't want to talk more about it. I don't want to be next.

??? -> What? I don't know what you mean.

goodbye -> bye.
