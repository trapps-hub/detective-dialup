****COMMISSIONER BAGLEY:****

CONVO NO.1 - COMMISH RINGS YOU:

Morning Detective, new case for you to work on and it needs top priority. If anyone can solve this one, it's you. Ready for a rundown?

No -> Well, too bad, you're clocked in.

The victim is a lawyer named Lawrence Macor, died in the early hours of the morning from blunt force trauma to the head. He was found in a motel room next to a bloody broken statuette a few hours after his death by the cleaning lady, bless her soul.

Anyways, this man was working over at Merriweather & Co and from the looks of his file had a winning streak for some time - clearly his luck ran out. I've sent you his details, and the number for The Sunset Motel. That'll be a good place to start.

I'm relying on you and your phone to crack this case - don't let me down. Good luck Detective.

CONVO NO.? - COMMISH CONGRATS (ENDING):

Detective? I hear you cracked the case - congrats. Looks like there was blood in the water after all. Haha!

... Enjoy your weekend - I'll see you soon for the next one I'm sure.

morning, night, murder, body, find, found, Lawrence, Macor -> Yes well, I was doing my rounds as I do each morning, and I came to Mr. Macor's door to find it ajar, so I went to check if he was okay and well... there he was! 
Horribly bloody head, and god it was everywhere, I'm not sure if I'll ever get it out of that carpet.

evidence, clues, suspects -> Well, there was the broken statuette by his head, also bloody. At least we can just replace those. There was also a single napkin in the trashcan that had some code written on it, and then his phone had made two calls. That's all I know.

napkin, code, trashcan -> It was just a random bunch of letters in red ink, --90W-D? No idea what that means.

phone, calls, record -> Yea let me just check our system...
Ok so, the first one went to that Merriweather & Co office, #989.
And the other call went to a #565, but that number isn't listed on our system.

witnesses, suspects, see, notice, saw -> I know one of the girls saw him leave at around dinnertime but he was back before midnight. We didn't see anything else after that - we usually clock out around 1AM.

goodbye, thank you -> Alright darlin, take care now, hope you catch 'em!
