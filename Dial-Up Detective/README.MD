##Inspiration

The project originally started as an excuse to mess with a novelty 80's tech became a full fledged story game using an old 1969 analogue rotary phone (Thank you Daudi's Mum!)
What it does

## What is it?

The premise is simple! Dial the number of suspects and witnesses with the rotary phone to solve the mysterious murder case of Lawrence Macor, a well established layers in Chicago 1984.
How we built it

## How did we do it?

Lots of hardware and suffering to get a 60-year old phone to act as our controller for the game. We hand crafted a story and dialogue for 6 characters (With no AI involved at all!) Then, using Unity, we display our case using a digital pin-board inspired by the early GUIs of the late 70s. This GUI is hand drawn!
Challenges we ran into

## What made us suffer

You'd think we learnt this last time, but pre-digital tech is black magic, and it refuses to tell you its secrets. Unity suuuuucks. Also writing is so hard!
Accomplishments that we're proud of
